          <p>As a Transformation Lead I have successfully contributed to the continuous improvement of JLR’s engineering processes. Utilisation of the following experience, skills and training enabled me to drive & deliver business transformation projects.</p>
          <p><b>Process Owner</b>. Process specialist for the Evidence Based Engineering Review procedure. Starting as a developer within a small scrum team to create an evi-dence-based review process for engineering. Which included developing a repository for engineers to manage their workload and enforcing an engineering review cadence within JLR’s product creation lifecycle process. Once the process was in place, I became the process lead to aid and improve the way thousands of engineers manage the approval of their engineering via the system created.</p>
          <p><b>Process Improvement</b>. Applying the Six Sigma methodology allowed me to support the engineer’s workload and achieve efficiency by aligning their design cards with the JLR’ Issue Management System, this informed them of local issues which may impact their activities. The approach presented the problem and solu-tion in a comprehensive way through coordinating with stakeholders, mapping processes via ARIS or Visio, producing supporting data, and presenting a solution which highlighted the cost vs benefit.</p>
          <p><b>Project Management & Planning</b>. Setting up a plan and development team to deliver the project. Key tasks include engaging and aligning stakeholders to project activities and generating project roadmaps. In addition to this, I governed projects to ensure good waterfall or agile project management methodolo-gies are adhered to. The tools used to ensure successful project delivery include MS Project and Jira, chairing daily/weekly progress meetings and managing the project plans and issue logs daily.</p>
          <p><b>Agile Scrum Management</b>. Led and supported large projects using Jira. The agile approach enabled the team to breakdown the project into epics, features and stories to deliver specified tasks via sprints as a scrum team. During my time at JLR I have been a product owner, scrum master and developer for various projects. Large project examples include; Evidence Based Engineering Review process (as mention above), Release to Order process (working cross-functionally to improve how JLR approve vehicle part designs, ordering parts and scheduling them to be built) and seconded to a taskforce project to support the change management of vehicles being built in China.</p>
          <p><b>Business Analyst</b>. Coordinated the migration of data from legacy systems to new systems, manipulated large data sets to present data in a visual way. I also oversee daily site administration duties which include data analysis, access management and handling business system improvement requests. During my time at JLR I have been seconded to the Product Information department to support data analysis activities including validation of complex vehicle input excel files. I am currently studying the Python programming language so have a general understanding of software development and an intermediate grasp of the language itself. I also have some experience writing SQL queries to extract and interpret data.</p>
          <p><b>Change Management</b>. Conducted change impact assessments of new manufacturing facilities to understand the impact to my department regarding people, processes, and systems.</p>
          <p><b>Communication</b>. Used various communication channels to clearly articulate project objectives. Drafted and obtained approval of communications to be sent out via Business Newsletters. Presented to various stakeholders including senior management and directors. Led workshops and smaller meetings to clearly convey the intentions of the improvement initiative and to gather stakeholder requirements. I have developed training packages which have included presenta-tions to various sized audiences (up to 40 in a room), video tutorials and procedure guidance.</p>
