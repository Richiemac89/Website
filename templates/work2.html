          <p>Responsible for global marketing campaigns and development of products. This role required extensive planning and market research to improve brand recogni-tion, reputability, and drive sales in the form of new products, campaigns or account relationship building. A broad spectrum of other responsibilities and key skills were also required to be an efficient VitaLink Brand Manager, as listed below:</p>
          <p><b>Project Management</b>. Achieved a successful rebranding of VitaLink in the UK and Europe within budget. This involved planning and organising an effec-tive rebrand strategy and delivering it to various countries in the required timescales. I led the sales team, suppliers and external stakeholders on brand projects and strategies that influenced the company’s revenue.</p>
          <p><b>Strategy Implementation</b>. Created a brand strategy and adhered to the plan of activities which led to a 20% increase of sales on the previous year. Whilst implementing the strategy I dealt with suppliers and negotiated deals to produce brand merchandise. I coordinated and produced the brand web-site, the design and manufacture of large exhibition stands, various promotional strategies and the content/design for a detailed product catalogue.</p>
          <p><b>Analytical</b>. Accurately analysing the cost benefit of implementing strategies to ensure the activities are within budget, and the benefits are greater than the costs. Analysed data such as account spend, product sales and end user information to understand correlations or trends which could influence brand performance. Using tools such as QlikView and excel I was able to produce comprehensive visuals reflecting the complex data sets.</p>
          <p><b>New Product Launch</b>. Innovation and spotting trends in the industry is important to keep the VitaLink brand strong. Through market research and coor-dinating with the necessary departments, I implemented several new products into the VitaLink range and effectively delivered them to market.</p>
          <p><b>Account Management</b>. Incentivised VitaLink’s national accounts with various strategies and tactics to increase sales, ensuring I went the extra mile for customers. Frequent national and international travel was also required to ensure great relationships were formed.</p>
          <p><b>Product Management</b>. Managed 30 products in the VitaLink range, which involved monitoring product sales and creating strategies for poor performing products in order to improve performance.</p>
          <p><b>Reports and Weekly Meetings</b>. Produced detailed reports on industry changes and the impact to VitaLink and presented updates to the directors and senior management team on a weekly basis.</p>
          <p><b>Copy Writing</b>. Devised product guides and various other literature for retailers, this required liaising with various departments to ensure the information and design was correct and translated into several European languages.</p>
